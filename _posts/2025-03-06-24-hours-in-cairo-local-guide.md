If you've only got one day to experience authentic Cairo, this 24-hour itinerary will show you the real heart of Egypt's capital. Cairo is obviously on your Egypt travel itinerary, but this day is different. You'll see no pyramids, ride no camels. This day is for Cairo – the living, breathing, pulsing life of the city.

My guess is you're flying in and out of Cairo, so you've planned your pyramid day and your Egyptian Museum visit – but what about experiencing the authentic Cairo that locals know and love? Before you board your plane home, let this be your last unforgettable look at Egypt.

I lived in Cairo for two years, from 2015-2017, in the part of downtown where even locals wondered how I ended up there. Just blocks from Tahrir Square and the bustling heart of the city, I thrived. Riding my bright yellow bike through Cairo's notorious rush hour traffic, eating 2 LE ful and falafel (in Cairo it's called tamiya), and sipping homemade sangria on my balcony overlooking the Nile. What a time to be alive.

Having recently returned with Mido to walk down memory lane, we revisited all my favorite Cairo spots and found them happily (mostly) exactly as I remembered.

*Note: In Alexandria, where Mido is from, it's still called falafel, but Cairo locals call it tamiya. This is oddly one of the Caireen things that's hard for me to let go of.

## Where to Stay for Your 24 Hours in **Cairo**

This Cairo itinerary focuses on downtown, so staying in the area maximizes your time. Garden City offers a nice contrast to the busy downtown energy while remaining perfectly located for exploring authentic Cairo neighborhoods.

### **Morning:** Garden City - Cairo's Hidden Gem

There's no rush to this Cairo morning. Wake at your leisure and make your way to Garden City, one of Cairo's most underrated neighborhoods. This quieter cousin to Mounira and downtown sets the perfect scene for a leisurely morning walk through authentic Cairo.

With stunning old British colonial architecture, the walk itself becomes the main activity. Wander through Garden City's winding streets and admire the high ceilings, ornate balconies, and lush greenery that gives this Cairo neighborhood its name. 

Grab a coffee from Beano's for your Cairo walking tour, or enjoy a sit-down breakfast at Room Arts Space and Cafe, a local favorite that perfectly captures Cairo's contemporary creative scene.

### **Midday:** Felucca Ride on the Nile - Essential Cairo Experience

An absolute must-do during your 24 hours in Cairo is a felucca ride on the Nile River. Day or night, these traditional sailboats offer the perfect perspective of Cairo's skyline and represent one of the most authentic Cairo experiences available.

Both motorboats and sailboats are available for hourly rental, but the traditional sailboat felucca provides a more serene experience. My tried-and-true spot is easy to find – directly across from the Four Seasons Garden City (no hotel affiliation needed). You'll see the sailboats' masts peeking up from the corniche, so cross the street and take the steps down to the Nile.

We secured an hour-long felucca ride for 400 LE (approximately $13), though note that Egyptian pound exchange rates fluctuate, so use this as a guideline for your Cairo budget planning.

### **Afternoon:** Khan El Khalili - Cairo's Historic Heart

Your final souvenir stop, or in Mido's case, the destination for Cairo's best stuffed pigeon, and for me, a visit with an old friend.

If you haven't tried pigeon during your Egypt travels, Khan El Khalili offers the perfect opportunity. Mostly dark meat similar to turkey leg, pigeons (hammam in Arabic) are a traditional Egyptian meal, stuffed with deliciously spiced rice and cooked until golden and crispy.

Farahat Restaurant represents Cairo dining at its most authentic – plastic tables tucked into narrow alleyways, serving locals who've been coming for decades. Don't miss the soup, served in a paper cup, alongside fresh aish baladi (Egyptian bread) and salad.

Full and satisfied, explore the rest of Khan El Khalili market. Twisting narrow alleyways that open into small plazas create the magic of this historic Cairo neighborhood. It’s busy and the shopkeepers heckle and haggle like the best of ‘em, but it’s all part of the fun - an authentic Cairo experience.

Fishawy Cafe is a classic choice for tea, fresh juice, or shisha, while Naguib Mahfouz offers a more upscale setting for your Cairo market break.

For my favorite Khan El Khalili spot, head to Naguib Mahfouz, but don't go inside. Amo Abdo (Uncle Abdo) sits at a small table directly in front of the cafe entrance. His modest display represents just a taste of the incredible embroidery and textile work his larger shop around the corner holds.

We struck a friendship when I bought a pillow with ‘Cairo’ in Arabic, and later came back requesting he make a computer case out of the basic cushion fabric of the market chairs (which are now his shop's best-seller). I spent many afternoons sitting with Amo, watching the shop and drinking 'ahwa mesboot' (medium-sweet Arabic coffee - literal translation being 'perfect coffee'). Every Cairo visit, I make time to pick up gifts for friends and reconnect with an old one.

### **Late Afternoon:** Mokattam - Cairo's Best Sunset Views

For spectacular sunset views overlooking all of Cairo, head up to Mokattam (pronounced Mo-at-tam, with the 'k' silent). Here you'll find Cairo's version of a mountain corniche at the cliff's edge.

Simple seating areas feature carpets on the ground and pillows against palm trunks, with vendors serving fresh mint tea or Arabic coffee. Nothing fancy, but the Cairo panoramic views are absolutely spectacular. On clear days, best in October or March, you can see all the way to the Giza pyramids from this Cairo vantage point.

### **Evening:** The Carlton - Downtown Cairo's Hidden Rooftop

Not to be confused with the Ritz, this Carlton sits in downtown Cairo's heart with an excellent rooftop garden. Stop for post-sundowner and experience authentic Cairo nightlife energy. 

Enjoy drinks and shisha while snacking on 'termis' – local boiled beans with salt and lime. Pro tip: don't eat the outer shell of the beans; it won't hurt you, but won't taste good either. Think of them like edamame.

The rest of your Cairo night is completely walkable from here.

### **Dinner:** Abu Tarek - Cairo's Koshary King

Koshary represents one of Egypt's most famous dishes and an essential Cairo food experience. The combination of noodles, rice, chickpeas, lentils, and tangy red sauce topped with fried onions might seem unusual, but it works incredibly well.

While you can find koshary on many Cairo street corners, Abu Tarek offers a complete experience. Silly fountains and bright lights announce their success, but they're famous for good reason. There's only one dish here, so order the special and add plenty of vinegar and spicy sauce for authentic Cairo flavor.

### **Night:** Horreya - Cairo's Legendary Freedom Bar

No Cairo experience is complete without visiting Horreya, meaning 'Freedom' in English. This legendary bar has served Cairo's creative community for decades.

Serving coffee during the day, one side of this simple shop transforms into a beer hall at night. Tables and chairs arrange differently each evening depending on the crowd. From beatniks and expats to longtime locals, you never know what mix you'll encounter, but everyone is welcome in this Cairo institution.

Find a table and the single server will crack open a Stella beer for you. As the night progresses, he circles the room, tapping fresh bottles for anyone ready for another. To pay, he simply counts the empty bottles on your table. Occasionally, someone selling chips passes through, or you can grab snacks from the 'kushk' (corner store) outside.

### **Late Night:** Samah - Cairo's Legendary Sandwich Shop

Once only a tiny food cart, Samah has grown into a (still small) hole-in-the-wall Cairo hotspot. You'll recognize it by the crowd of people waiting – it seems chaotic, but it's absolutely worth the wait for this authentic Cairo street food experience.

Don't be shy about approaching the counter directly. The entire menu is in Arabic, which adds to the adventure. Each sandwich is named after the person who made it popular – the Karim Allam being the crowd favorite among Cairo food enthusiasts.

The strategy is ordering several sandwiches, and at just over a dollar each, you might be tempted to try Samah's entire menu. This represents the perfect end to your authentic 24 hours in Cairo – surrounded by locals, speaking Arabic, and experiencing the real Cairo that exists beyond any tourist itinerary.
