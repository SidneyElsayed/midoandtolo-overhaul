*Everyone in our adventure family has a name. Well that might sound obvious, but not when you realize who and what is considered part of our travel family.*

## **Mido - The Marketing Mastermind (Funny Enough Though, Not Ours)**

Don't let the big hair fool you, there are plenty of secrets hidden in that head of his. Ahmed is a mastermind of social media, paid campaign wiz and all-around marketing genius in his professional life – but when it comes to our adventures, he's strictly off-duty from anything marketing-related. From his start as real-life 'Scuba Steve' in Egypt's Red Sea to his current work helping put Saudi Arabia on the map as an international travel destination, I'm convinced there's nothing this man can't do. Mashallah, his expertise is incredible, but the closest he gets to our social media strategy is telling me I really should post more on TikTok.

## **Tolo - The Adventure Travel Writer & Developer**

An adventurous spirit with a will to wander, I'm Sidney, the writer/developer/photographer/content creator half of Mido and Tolo. I've learned that no one person is just one thing. These days you'll find me juggling custom website development, SEO optimization, photography shoots around AlUla's stunning landscapes, and managing our social media accounts. Whether I'm coding a new site, capturing the perfect desert sunset, or writing travel stories about our Saudi adventures, I'm always ready for the next creative challenge. Having coined the phrase 'No Plan Plan' early on in my life, when in doubt – just wing it.

## **ZouZou - Our Saudi-Born Rescue Star & Local Ambassador**

Saudi-born rescue pup, ZouZou is just ZouZou – we don't know her breed, nor do we really want to – though it's always fun to speculate. Her name comes from the Egyptian classic "Khalli Balak min ZouZou" (Watch out for ZouZou) because when she was a tiny puff, she had very dramatic eyeliner reminiscent of the 70s Arab movie stars. Stubborn and sweet, she's changing the way people in Saudi Arabia view dogs one pat at a time. As our four-legged travel companion, ZouZou has become quite the local celebrity around AlUla and during our Saudi adventures.

## **Raptor - Our Epic Saudi Road Trip Vehicle**

Big boy Raptor is a silver 2014 Ford Raptor, and he's been our trusty companion for countless Saudi Arabia road trips. He joined the fam just before we took off on the first epic road trip from Dubai to AlUla, when we were in need of a true [adventure car](https://midoandtolo.com/posts/2024/wild-camping-saudi "Road Trips & Wild Camping in Saudi"). (The little Kia rental just couldn't cut it for Saudi's rugged terrain.) Two years in, he's racked up over 40,000km (almost 25,000 miles) exploring everything from Saudi's desert landscapes to coastal roads.

## **Charlie - The Cape Town Survivor Turned Saudi Explorer**

A South African thrifted single-speed, Charlie kept me sane during covid. From photo tours of Cape Town's street art, navigating the cafes of Muizenberg and playing with the penguins of Simon's Town, Charlie had to continue on the adventure – Mido even somewhat held him for ransom in Dubai (but that's another story). Now Charlie explores the quieter streets of AlUla and has become quite the conversation starter with locals curious about cycling in Saudi Arabia.

## **Mr. Giant - Charlie's Adventure Companion & Dubai-to-Saudi Veteran**

When I got to Dubai, Charlie felt lonely, so Mido got Mr. Giant second-hand. A trusty steed, Mr. Giant has traversed the Dubai Marina as well as AlUla's Oasis paths. Definitely more hearty than Charlie, the pair have had their share of adventures together, from UAE city cycling to exploring Saudi Arabia's ancient oasis towns.

## Our Adventure Family's Saudi Arabia Journey

From Egypt's Red Sea coast to Saudi Arabia's stunning landscapes, our gang has been through quite the journey together. Whether it's ZouZou charming locals in AlUla's Oasis, Raptor conquering Saudi's wild camping spots and desert roads, or the bikes exploring new neighborhoods from Dubai to AlUla, each member of our family brings something special to our Middle East adventures.

This eclectic mix of personalities (human, canine, and mechanical) makes up our travel family as we explore Saudi Arabia's hidden gems and share our expat life experiences. From road trip adventures to cultural discoveries, we're always ready for the next Saudi adventure with our complete gang in tow.
