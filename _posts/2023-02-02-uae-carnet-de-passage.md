Getting ready for our epic road trip from Dubai to AlUla meant preparing our vehicle for international travel too. We're not overland travel experts (yet!), so we almost forgot the most essential document needed for cross-border driving: a Carnet de Passage.

If you're planning overland travel from the UAE to neighboring countries, this step-by-step guide will walk you through exactly how to get your Carnet de Passage in Dubai, including costs, locations, and requirements for 2025.

## What is a **Carnet** de Passage?

Think of a Carnet de Passage as a passport for your car. This official document proves you're the vehicle owner and allows your car to legally cross certain international borders from the UAE. Without it, you won't be able to take your vehicle on that dream overland adventure through the Middle East.

## Where Can You Travel with a **UAE** Carnet de Passage?

With your UAE Carnet de Passage (assuming you also have valid visas for these destinations), you're permitted to enter:

- **Saudi Arabia** - Perfect for AlUla adventures or Riyadh business trips
- **Oman** - Explore the stunning Musandam Peninsula or Salalah
- **Qatar** - Quick drive to Doha for events or business
- **Bahrain** - Easy island getaway via King Fahd Causeway
- **Kuwait** - Northern Gulf exploration
- **Iraq** - For adventurous overland travelers

**Important Note:** UAE Carnet de Passage does NOT allow entry to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, or Yemen - they can be added for an additional cost. Plan your overland routes accordingly.

## Required **Documents** for UAE Carnet de Passage

Before heading to get your Carnet de Passage in Dubai, gather these essential documents:

#### **Must-Have Documents:**
- **Emirates ID** (original)
- **Car registration** (original - vehicle must be registered in your name)
- **You must be the registered owner** and the person crossing borders with the vehicle

#### **Recommended Additional Documents:**
- UAE passport (original)
- UAE driving license (original)
- Photocopies of all documents (just in case)

We brought our passports and driving licenses plus copies of everything, but didn't need the extras. However, it's better to be over-prepared for UAE government processes.

## Step-by-Step Process: Getting Your Carnet de Passage in **Dubai**

Getting your UAE Carnet de Passage is surprisingly quick and straightforward - our entire process took just a few hours. Here's exactly what to do:

#### **Step 1: Emirates Motorsports Organization (EMSO)**

- **Location:** [Emirates Motorsports Organization (EMSO)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/faLyZ8XF4LVbK6Xc6){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- **Opening Time:** 9:00 AM 
- **Pro Tip:** Arrive early to avoid lines

Google Maps will get you there easily. Enter through the side door into a small room with a few staff members usually enjoying their morning tea and several rows of waiting seats.

**CRITICAL:** They **only accept cash** - no cards accepted. There's an ATM nearby if you need cash.

**Cost:** **925 AED total**
- 425 AED processing fee
- 500 AED refundable deposit (returned when you bring the car back to UAE)

The 500 AED deposit ensures you're not illegally exporting the vehicle - it's fully refundable upon your return. You'll receive a receipt and your official Carnet de Passage document.

#### **Step 2: CARS Vehicle Testing Centre**

- **Location:** [CARS Vehicle Testing Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/koZyMGqmXLyqEsgQ6){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (RTA licensed) 
- **Distance:** Just down the road from EMSO

At this second location, you'll need to:
- Show your new Carnet de Passage
- Obtain a Trip Ticket

**CRITICAL:** Again, they **only accept cash** - no cards accepted.

**Cost:** **365 AED**

This Trip Ticket notifies RTA that you're traveling internationally with your vehicle, updating their system to allow smooth exit from the UAE.

## Total Cost **Summary** for UAE Carnet de Passage

- **EMSO:** 925 AED (500 AED refundable deposit + 425 AED fee)
- **CARS Centre:** 365 AED
- **Total Out-of-Pocket:** 1,290 AED
- **Actual Cost:** 790 AED (after 500 AED deposit refund)

## Pro Tips for **UAE** Carnet de Passage Process

1. **Bring Extra Cash:** Both locations only accept cash, and ATM trips can delay the process
2. **Start Early:** Arrive at EMSO right at 9 AM to avoid potential lines
3. **Plan Same Day:** Complete both steps on the same day for efficiency
4. **Keep Documents Safe:** Your Carnet de Passage is essential for border crossings
5. **Plan Return:** Remember you need to return to UAE to get your 500 AED deposit back

## Ready for Your UAE Overland **Adventure**

Once you have your Carnet de Passage and Trip Ticket, you're officially ready to hit the road for incredible overland adventures from the UAE! Whether you're planning a Dubai to AlUla road trip, exploring Oman's mountains, or crossing into Saudi Arabia for business, your vehicle is now legally prepared for international travel.

The process might seem bureaucratic, but it's surprisingly efficient once you know exactly what to do and where to go. Now you're ready to experience the freedom of overland travel in the Middle East!
